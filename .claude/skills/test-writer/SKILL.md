Write comprehensive tests for the code that was just added or changed.

## Step 1: Discover What Changed

- Check `git diff` and `git diff --cached` to identify new/modified functions, classes, and modules
- Read each changed file to understand the behavior being added
- Identify the project's existing test framework, patterns, and conventions by finding existing test files
- Place new test files next to the source files or in the project's established test directory — match whatever the project already does

## Step 2: Analyze Every Code Path

For each new or modified function/method/component, map out:

- **Happy path** — normal input, expected output
- **Edge cases** — empty input, single element, boundary values (0, 1, -1, MAX_INT)
- **Null/undefined/nil** — what happens with missing data
- **Type boundaries** — wrong types, type coercion traps
- **Error paths** — invalid input, network failures, timeouts, permission denied
- **Concurrency** — race conditions, parallel calls with shared state
- **State transitions** — initial state, intermediate states, final state
- **Integration points** — how this code interacts with its dependencies

## Step 3: Write the Tests

For EACH scenario identified above, write a test. No skipping.

### Structure

- **One assertion per test** — if a test name needs "and", split it into two tests
- **Descriptive names** — test names read as sentences describing the behavior:
  - `should return empty array when input is empty`
  - `should throw ValidationError when email format is invalid`
  - `should retry 3 times before failing on network timeout`
- **Arrange-Act-Assert** — set up, execute, verify. Clear separation.

### What to Test

**Pure functions / business logic:**
- Every branch (if/else, switch, ternary)
- Every thrown error with exact error type and message
- Return value types and shapes
- Side effects (mutations, calls to external services)

**API endpoints / handlers:**
- Success response (status code, body shape, headers)
- Validation errors for each field (missing, wrong type, out of range)
- Authentication/authorization failures
- Rate limiting behavior if applicable
- Idempotency for non-GET methods

**UI components (if applicable):**
- Renders without crashing with required props
- Renders correct content for each state (loading, error, empty, populated)
- User interactions trigger correct callbacks (click, submit, type, select)
- Accessibility: focusable, keyboard navigable, correct ARIA attributes
- Conditional rendering — each branch shows/hides correct elements

**Database / data layer:**
- CRUD operations return correct data
- Unique constraints reject duplicates
- Cascade deletes work as expected
- Transactions roll back on failure

**Async operations:**
- Successful resolution
- Rejection / error handling
- Timeout behavior
- Cancellation if supported
- Concurrent calls don't interfere

### Mocking Rules

- Prefer real implementations over mocks
- Only mock at system boundaries: network, filesystem, clock, random
- Never mock the code under test
- If you mock, verify the mock was called with expected arguments
- Reset mocks between tests — no shared state leaking

## Step 4: Verify

- Run the new tests — confirm they all pass
- Temporarily break the code (change a return value or condition) — confirm at least one test fails
- If no test fails when code is broken, the tests are useless — rewrite them
- Check coverage: every new function should have at least one test, every branch should be exercised

## Output

- Complete, runnable test file(s) — not snippets
- Tests grouped by the function/component they cover
- A brief summary: how many tests, what scenarios covered, any gaps you couldn't cover and why
