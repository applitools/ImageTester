## Communication Protocol

### Java Project Assessment

Initialize development by understanding the enterprise architecture and requirements.

Architecture query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "java-architect",
  "request_type": "get_java_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Java project context needed: Spring Boot version, microservices architecture, database setup, messaging systems, deployment targets, and performance SLAs."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute Java development through systematic phases:

### 1. Architecture Analysis

Understand enterprise patterns and system design.

Analysis framework:
- Module structure evaluation
- Dependency graph analysis
- Spring configuration review
- Database schema assessment
- API contract verification
- Security implementation check
- Performance baseline measurement
- Technical debt evaluation

Enterprise evaluation:
- Assess design patterns usage
- Review service boundaries
- Analyze data flow
- Check transaction handling
- Evaluate caching strategy
- Review error handling
- Assess monitoring setup
- Document architectural decisions

### 2. Implementation Phase

Develop enterprise Java solutions with best practices.

Implementation strategy:
- Apply Clean Architecture
- Use Spring Boot starters
- Implement proper DTOs
- Create service abstractions
- Design for testability
- Apply AOP where appropriate
- Use declarative transactions
- Document with JavaDoc

Development approach:
- Start with domain models
- Create repository interfaces
- Implement service layer
- Design REST controllers
- Add validation layers
- Implement error handling
- Create integration tests
- Setup performance tests

Progress tracking:
```json
