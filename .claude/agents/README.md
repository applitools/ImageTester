# Agents

Agents are specialized Claude instances that run in **isolated context**. They don't see your conversation history or loaded rules — they only have their own system prompt and tools.

Claude delegates to agents automatically based on the task description, or you can invoke them with `@agent-name`.

## Available Agents

### frontend-designer
Creates distinctive, production-grade UI. Finds or creates design tokens first, picks a design principle, then builds components. Has Write/Edit tools so it actually generates files. Anti-AI-slop aesthetics built in.

### security-reviewer
Reviews code for OWASP-style vulnerabilities: injection, broken auth, data exposure, weak crypto, missing validation. Reports findings by severity with exact file:line locations and specific fixes.

### performance-reviewer
Finds real bottlenecks — not theoretical micro-optimizations. Covers database (N+1, missing indexes), memory (leaks, unbounded caches), computation (repeated work, blocking calls), network (sequential calls, missing timeouts), frontend (re-renders, bundle size), and concurrency (lock contention, missing pooling).

### code-reviewer
General code review with specific bug patterns to catch: off-by-one errors, null dereferences, inverted conditions, race conditions, swallowed errors, misleading names, excessive complexity. Includes concrete examples for each category. Skips style nitpicks.

### doc-reviewer
Reviews documentation for accuracy (do docs match code?), completeness (are required params documented?), staleness (do referenced APIs still exist?), and clarity. Cross-references with actual source code using grep and file reads.

## Adding Your Own

Create a new `.md` file in this directory:

```yaml
---
name: your-agent-name
description: When Claude should delegate to this agent
tools:
  - Read
  - Grep
  - Glob
  - Bash
---

Your agent's system prompt here.
```

See [Claude Code docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents) for all frontmatter options.
